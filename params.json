  "body": "Sublime-AutoSetNewFileSyntax\r\n============================\r\nThis plugin automatically sets the syntax for a plain text content depends on its first line. The original thought is from [here](https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/automatically-set-view-syntax-according-to-first-line/18629).\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n========\r\n![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfcherng/Sublime-AutoSetNewFileSyntax/gh-pages/images/example.gif)\r\n\r\nIf we create a new file in Sublime Text and type `<?php`, this plugin will set the syntax to PHP automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow It Works\r\n============\r\n0. Read all syntax definition files.\r\n0. Try to find `first_line_match` in `.sublime-syntax`s and `firstLineMatch` in `.tmLanguage`s.\r\n0. Match the first line with results we found in the last step.\r\n0. If there is any luck, set the corresponding syntax for the user.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Works\r\n============\r\n- Let user add their own `first_line_match` and the corresponding syntax pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Also\r\n========\r\n- [ApplySyntax](https://github.com/facelessuser/ApplySyntax)\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Jack Cherng\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
